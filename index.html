      <h2>why to do a tattoo?</h2>
      <p>
        Many tattoos serve as rites of passage, marks of status and rank,
        symbols of religious and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery,
        marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection,
        and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts.
        Extensive decorative tattooing has also been part of the work of
        performance artists such as tattooed ladies. Although tattoo art has
        existed since the first known tattooed person, Otzi, lived around the
        year 3330 BC, the way society perceives tattoos has varied immensely
        throughout history. In the 20th century, tattoo art throughout most of
        the world was associated with a limited selection of specific "rugged"
        lifestyles, notably sailors and prisoners. Today, people choose to be
        tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and
        spiritual reasons, or to symbolize their belonging to or identification
        with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos)
        or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Tattoos may show
        how a person feels about a relative (commonly a parent or child) or
        about an unrelated person.[1]
